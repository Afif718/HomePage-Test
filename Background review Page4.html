      <p>Before coronavirus, online classes were for students who work a full time job or for people who cannot travel long distances to attend class. Now because of the pandemic, students from elementary school, middle school, high school and university are attending online classes. We don’t know when this pandemic will end so the online classes might go on for a long time. 
Let’s take a look at how the students have been affected by this online class. Firstly, the students are happy about not having to spend money on transport and that they are able to attend classes from the comfort of their home. Then again a lot of students do not have access to proper internet or gadgets like a laptop. These students prefer face to face classes. In some cases students can select their class timing. [6]
The students have lost interest in learning as online classes are not as helpful or interesting as face to face classes were. Although some students who are weak at studies or just shy can ask questions without feeling scared, judged or nervous. The students have a very short attention span when it comes to online classes. Many students simply do not listen to the lecturer during class as they think they can just see/listen to the videos/recordings of the class later.
Student’s mental health have been affected as well due to this coronavirus situation. They are feeling depressed and lonely [7]. Parents and students are stressed out. Some students who study abroad are concerned about their family’s health and they cannot even travel back to their own countries [8]. Those who did go back to their own countries are facing problems as are unable to acquire books or good internet connection. The online lab classes are also very difficult to attend.  One good thing is there are resources online that students can take help from. For example YouTube or articles [9].</p>
