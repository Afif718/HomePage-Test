      <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic forced the education system to shut worldwide and make billions of students out of classrooms, that time the online education system dramatically changed the whole situation. Attending classes from anywhere now super easy for such online platform, this is how the e-learning system cuts down travel, cost, accommodation along with provides safe, flexible, advanced learning system. <br>

<p>As the present world education depends on the e-learning system, the teachers, students with their parents, and educational institutions are trying to cope with the wave; some are wondering seeing the adoption results. Will this continue after the pandemic? How this system will affect students' academic performance?<br> 
Besides the Coronavirus pandemic, several factors contributed to the growth of online enrolment, including the following :</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Younger people are choosing non-traditional education to start and advance in their careers while completing and furthering their education.</b>
</li>
<li><b>Severe recession of 2008 has created poor economic situations where people are upgrading/changing their career through online educational/training programs.</b></li>
</ul> <p>
A student can now join the classes at home if he wants by contacting the teachers directly and even solving various textbook problems. Moreover, to online lessons, students can use the internet to view and read multiple educational websites. These have been a blessing for many students during this global epidemic.
We all know every coin has two sides; online education also not beyond. Here we will broadly discuss all these aspects; also, we will highlight the researchers’ point of view. As well, we will try to sort out how students can use this online platform more efficiently, overcoming all the shortcomings. Let's dive in-depth.

           Here we will talk about why students are taking online classes. Due to the current situation in the world, the corona virus pandemic, most of the schools, colleges and universities are closed. To keep everyone safe government of different countries told teachers and students to attend online classes. So that everyone will stay at home and less risk of them getting infected. <br>

Now are the students getting better grades after taking online classes? The students have to prepare themselves about the lecture before attending the class. It was seen that boys, black students, and teenage students had bad grades compared to others [2]. If they don’t pay attention in class then they will not get better grades. In online class the teacher cannot observe the students, cannot make sure if they are understanding the topic or not. 
This brings me to my next point, how much are the students actually learning from online class? The students are learning just for the sake of exams and only a few are they learning to remember and imply it in real life. Talking about exams, most students can now cheat easily while giving online exam. Since there’s no invigilator, no one will know which student gave exam honestly and which one did not. So to minimize this, sometimes there is a timer given.      
Does the students and teachers prefer online classes or face to face classes? There are both advantages and disadvantages to online class. Most teacher prefer face to face class whereas some students prefer online class. When it comes to student many are not happy about online class but there’s also a significant amount of students who are satisfied with it.
