			<p><b><i>This year</i></b> has been a challenging one, due to the <b>coronavirus pandemic</b> all of the educational institutes has been <b>closed</b>.  So now students are taking <b>online classes</b> to continue their education. As the coronavirus cases keep increasing, I think it is better to attend classes from online, so that everyone stays safe and does not get affected by this deadly disease. Online classes and wearing masks outside is the new normal, students have to be strong and keep going in this tough situation.Many students are liking online classes compared to traditional face to face classes. Then students can use the internet to get help from multiple <b>educational websites</b>. This has been a <b>blessing</b> for many students during this pandemic.We should also remember that online classes are a double-edged sword. Here we will look into the reasons why online classes are<b> good and bad</b>. In the objective, we have answered some common questions and provided a few solutions to the problems of how to void the problems.<b> In the problem statement</b>, we have talked about the most common problems faced by the students in general. Here we did not specifically talk about one country, we have talked about some of the basic and common things happening in most counties right now, involving online classes and students. Overall you will get an idea of the <b>favourable situations</b> and <b>some issues</b> students are having with online classes.<b> E-Learning have both pros and cons</b>. And it has been compared with traditional studies in the discussion part.<b> Online classes have many advantages</b> for the future as well as present life but it also comes with so many disadvantages. This all disadvantages results in bad grades for the students. E-Learning is going to be the best way of learning in future but for that we need to keep in mind the cons of online classes. If things are taken into schedules, all disadvantages can be prevented and result in better grades.
