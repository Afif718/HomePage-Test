      <p>Regarding attitude towards eLearning among the experimental group in this study, it shows a significant favourable influence. Traditional universities are still considered as the best way to adapt knowledge and get a degree for many people. Going to the universities, attending lectures then group studies are the traditional way of learning. Now in this pandemic eLearning is the only way people can move forward as people are not allowed to go out. There are many disadvantages of online education, here things are totally different from physical classes. Students and lecturers or teachers have to face so many problems. The authenticity of a particular student's work is also a problem as online just about anyone can do a project rather than the actual student itself [10] . It also lacks personal interaction; not having the option to actually connect with others can prompt the inability to accomplish the learning objectives and outcomes of the online training course.

For this in future people have to face problem while communicating with others. Nothing can replace human contact, no matter how hard we try to fully transfer human communication to online platforms, regardless of how normal it appears to frame connections behind PC screens, a virtual situation is simply not human. Internet is mainly used by students for fun and to spend their leisure time.  So many students open the mobile to learn something and end up using social media websites, chatting, sharing pictures, or playing video games [11]. There are so many things that can cause distraction during the classes. Every course or subject cannot be studied through eLearning such as engineering course or any other course that requires labs or hands-on workshops cannot be taken online. Online classes have some bad effect on students especially international students. Due to COVID-19, most of them went to their respective countries. Therefore, Students in various time regions than their institutions are presently relinquishing rest to wake up for classes on Zoom or any meeting software. This results in changing regular sleep patterns affects the body's circadian rhythm or internal biological clock, it also changes you’re eating timetable for this sometimes you don’t feel to have your meal. Looking at the computer or mobile screen for long is not good for our eyes. Sometimes sitting in one position for very long can give you a back pain. They are also getting lazy due to studying in one place. Where in traditional learning, students have to walk, roam and sometimes run when they are late for the class.

Be that as it may, with regards to eLearning, this feeling of network is difficult to duplicate in a web-based setting. For the most part, numerous instructive sites do offer gatherings and network strings, yet these are regularly ineffectively utilized. At the point when we went to physical classes, talks, and preparing, there is a set timetable and time responsibility previously spread out for understudies. This makes time the board "simpler" as there is all the more a structure and timetable to focus on. ELearning then again is incredibly adaptable as is most appropriate to spin around one's timetable, way of life, and work. While this can be viewed as a positive, it can turn into a significant impediment for the individuals who battle with time the board. With the idea of eLearning and taking courses on the web, there is no physical participation one needs to show when taking appraisals, tests, tests, and preparing. Along these lines, online courses can without much of a stretch be hoodwinked by redistributing, outsider assistance, and guided help. To battle this, numerous MOOCs "Massive Open Online Courses" and LMS "Learning Management Systems" presently use AI to distinguish cheating, and even live video associations with guarantees understudies and laborers are really present.
Advantages of online learning that explain why eLearning may be the greatest revolution in today's education. Almost every student is taking online classes in 2020. Forget about attending classes for hours, sitting in an uncomfortable chair, and suffering from back pain by the end of the day [12].

  Now you can learn more out of your lecture slides or syllabus which can be helpful for your future. Online classes help a student to learn more about technologies and uses of varies software that can make their work easier. This improves their technical skills, which will be very helpful for their job life. Time is very important in our life. Online studies also save our traveling time, which we can use to study more and get better grades. It also saves a lot of money that we use for travelling. As everything is available on online, we don’t have to spend money of buying different books. Accessing class materials and submitting assignments and homework are very convenient. You can save money on your vehicle maintenance and save fuel. Exactly when and where this takes place is up to the student, as long as assignment due dates are met. Although online learners may pay the same per-credit tuition rate as an on-campus degree- and certificate-seekers, they do not pay for on-campus housing or meal plans [13]. E-Learning is a way of learning using without papers, it protects the environment. 

 <br>
 <br>
  Studies done on eLearning courses, it has been found that eLearning programs consumed around 80% less power and generated 85% less amount of CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emissions as compared to traditional campus-based educational courses. With eLearning, there is no need to cut trees for obtaining paper. So, eLearning is a highly eco-friendly way of learning. Percentage of carbon dioxide is increasing as people are cutting down trees for making paper and many other reasons. Sometimes seeing your college course instructor face to face is not convenient, so now we can live chat, email and telephone communication. It is also good for those students who don’t like to communicate in front of everyone in the class. This also gives more opportunities to have Q&A session with the course instructor. In traditional learning we have wait for our test marks to release but in online classes learning system can immediately give us our marks or how well we did in your exam or quizzes. Regardless of what your ideal field of study, you can nearly locate an online program, whether that is nursing, arithmetic, science, bookkeeping or pretty much some other program. What's more, more projects are being included by schools each day. There really is a possibility for nearly everybody.

   If your program is not offered online by your school, inquire as to whether there are any comparable alternatives or adaptable credits you could get from other school. Ordinarily, getting a professional education requires leaving your place of employment. All things considered, it tends to be hard to shuffle the requests of school and work all the while. Be that as it may, in case you're composed and self-trained, it's frequently conceivable to do both. Since you don't need to go to class at a particular time, you can satisfy the elements of your activity and study during your spare time. You can likewise utilize ends of the week to complete extra work that you didn't possess energy for during the week. Indeed, it's requesting. Truly, it's a great deal of work. Be that as it may, on the off chance that you need to continue working while at the same time getting a degree, you can get it going with online classes. With traditional classes, you need to work around the college plan. In the event that your class is at 4 p.m., you must be in the study hall around then and you need to go to the whole talk.

    Neglecting to do those things will bring about missing significant data. Online classes make it such a great amount of simpler to fit things into your timetable. You can tune in to addresses on your drive to work. You can watch recordings on the train or transport. You can react to remarks while sitting in the café. You can even watch part of a talk, delay it, and afterward return to it at a helpful time. On the off chance that you have an effectively full timetable, online classes are the ideal arrangement
