      <p>One of the major problems that we will discuss about is the teachers not knowing how to use technology. Many of the university professors are old, school teachers are not accustomed to using digital technology. This creates a problem between the teacher and the students. The students are from either generation Z or millennial so they do not have any problem using the latest technology. Instead of helping the teacher figure out how to use these technology, they look at it as an excuse to not attend class or skip class. 
Speaking of skipping classes, these students are very irresponsible. Without any valid reason they are skipping classes, this will cause them their future which they are not aware of. They have become lazy [3].Even if they are aware they are careless and disregardful. 
Then there are students who does not have access to internet or technology devices. They may come from unprivileged families. Buying these expensive smartphones or laptops is not their first priority. They somehow manage to attend classes and submit their assignments. Some of them completely stopped attending classes and dropped out of school.
 On the other hand these websites get overloaded and stops working as plenty of students are attending class. Thereâ€™s no proper internet connection [4] .The computer system crashes because of using too many apps. This causes teachers to reschedule classes, they have to change the lesson plans [5] Students might take this as another excuse to stop attending classes.
